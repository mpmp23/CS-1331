# CS-1331
My personal self-study work of Georgia Tech's CS 1331 curriculum. This repository reflects a progression from foundational Java programming to more advanced object-oriented design patterns and system modeling.

# Projects done so far:
1. Histogram
  - Implemented a frequency-analysis tool that processes input data and outputs formatted histograms. The project emphasizes array-based counting, input parsing, and control-flow logic to transform raw data into structured summaries.
  - Concepts practiced: Arrays, loops, conditionals, input handling, formatted console output.
2. Source Model/Markov Chain
  - Built a probabilistic source model that learns character-level transition probabilities from text corpora and evaluates the likelihood that a given string was generated by each model. This project introduces statistical modeling through structured data representations.
  - Concepts practiced: 2D arrays, class design, text normalization, probability computation, command-line interfaces.
3. Vending Machine Simulation
  - Designed a vending machine system with inventory tracking, randomized behavior, and dynamic pricing using enums. The program supports item dispensing by code, tracks sales, and models probabilistic “free item” rewards.
  - Concepts practiced: Enums with fields and methods, multi-dimensional arrays, randomness, object-oriented design, state management.
4. 'Evil Chipotle' (aka practice with OOP and inheritance)
  - Implemented a small object-oriented system modeling different AI agents with distinct behaviors, using inheritance and polymorphism. The project emphasizes clean abstraction, method overriding, and interaction between collaborating classes.
  - Concepts practiced: Abstract classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, method overriding, class hierarchies.

# I have read Dr. Y. Daniel Liang's Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures, and applied the concepts held within in each homework problem I practice.
