# CS-1331
My personal self-study work of Georgia Tech's CS 1331 curriculum. This repository reflects a progression from foundational Java programming to more advanced object-oriented design patterns and system modeling. They should be organized into .zip files which host all relevant subfiles.
You can access the curriculum and the problem descriptions here -- https://gitlab.com/cs1331/cs1331.gitlab.io/-/tree/master/fall2018/hw5?ref_type=heads

# Projects done so far:
1. Histogram
  - Implemented a frequency-analysis tool that processes input data and outputs formatted histograms. The project emphasizes array-based counting, input parsing, and control-flow logic to transform raw data into structured summaries.
  - Concepts practiced: Arrays, loops, conditionals, input handling, formatted console output.
2. Source Model/Markov Chain
  - Built a probabilistic source model that learns character-level transition probabilities from text corpora and evaluates the likelihood that a given string was generated by each model. This project introduces statistical modeling through structured data representations.
  - Concepts practiced: 2D arrays, class design, text normalization, probability computation, command-line interfaces.
3. Vending Machine Simulation
  - Designed a vending machine system with inventory tracking, randomized behavior, and dynamic pricing using enums. The program supports item dispensing by code, tracks sales, and models probabilistic “free item” rewards.
  - Concepts practiced: Enums with fields and methods, multi-dimensional arrays, randomness, object-oriented design, state management.
4. 'Evil Chipotle' (aka practice with OOP and inheritance)
  - Implemented a small object-oriented system modeling different AI agents with distinct behaviors, using inheritance and polymorphism. The project emphasizes clean abstraction, method overriding, and interaction between collaborating classes.
  - Concepts practiced: Abstract classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, method overriding, class hierarchies.
5. Custom Generic List (Array-Backed Implementation)
  - Implemented a custom generic list data structure from scratch using a dynamically resizing backing array. The list supports insertion, retrieval, replacement, removal, and export operations while maintaining a clear separation between logical size and physical capacity. Capacity automatically doubles when full, mirroring core behaviors of Java’s ArrayList.
  - Concepts practiced: Java generics, interface implementation, backing arrays, dynamic resizing, exception handling, object equality vs reference equality, loop invariants.
6. ATM Transaction Filtering (Predicates, Lambdas, and Inner Classes)
  - Built a transaction-query subsystem for an ATM application that filters historical transactions using predicate-based rules. The design separates data storage from filtering logic via a reusable predicate engine, enabling flexible queries such as deposits, withdrawals, amount-based searches, and comment-based filters without mutating the original transaction history. The project progressively implements filtering rules using named inner classes, anonymous inner classes, and lambda expressions to demonstrate multiple Java paradigms for defining behavior.
  - Concepts practiced: Functional interfaces (Predicate<T>), named inner classes, anonymous inner classes, lambda expressions, enums, immutability and defensive copying, encapsulation, Optional usage, higher-order methods, separation of concerns.

### I have read Dr. Y. Daniel Liang's Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures, and applied the concepts held within in each homework problem I practice.
